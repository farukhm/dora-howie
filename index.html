        <p>There are many theories about Denver International Airport, but this webpage will focus on, the blue horse statue
            called the "Blue Mustang", the New World Order and some references to Nazi Germany . </p>
        
        <p> The <i>Blue Mustang</i> is a blue horse sculpture with glowing blood red eyes located near the airport. This really
            isn't a theory, since this actually happnened, but this "theory" is about the sculpture Luis Jimenez having the
            statue fall on him. The collision took away his life. </p>

<p> There are many murals on the walls of Denver Airport, which indicate some references to Nazi Germany or some believe they could be 
    about the New World Order. This is a theory, because no internatinal public building would have random strange murals on the walls like this airport.</p>
